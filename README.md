# Subnet Portal CRUD application
This is my first larger web application built with NodeJS, Express, MySQL and React.JS.
The Express backend and React frontend are communicating via proxy set in /client/package.json.
The app will not run with given files as there is no DB that it connect to, works only in internal network where db is running.
This is to showcase how I code.
